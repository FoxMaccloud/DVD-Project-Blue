# Deloppgave 1
Since last time, our group went from five members to four. 
Our teamleder, Jørn, chose to withdraw from the course. 
Jørn had a lot of experience within programming and game development and therefore appeared as a natural leader to the group. 
As a consequence of this we had to choose a new team leader, and after a short discussion we selected Tord. 
He will also continue his role as the git-expert.  This change of roles and dynamic is a good example on what we can except in the future while working in teams. 
It is important to adapt to the changes and discuss how we should solve it in the best possible way. 

The group communication goes mainly through Slack, where we discuss commits, meetings etc. 
As of now we haven’t had many group meetings outside the weekly planned meetings with the TAs but we think that will change throughout the semester. 
We consider the group dynamic as good and it is easy to come up with suggestions or recommendations. 
Within the group, the skill in programming differs. Håkon is considered to be the person with least experience in Java but is willing to learn from the others and contribute where he can.  

As of now, we have managed to create a well-design board displaying cards and robots and also decided the structure of code.
We have decided on which interfaces and what classes the game should have. Until the next time
