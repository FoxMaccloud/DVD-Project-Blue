All graphics/tiles are made by Gytis from scratch using Adobe Photshop.  
This is a V2.0. A lot of improvements have been made from V1.0.  
Many tiles were based on original tileset, which was provided on mitt uib.  
Some small improvements/changes might come under the project development.

SourceFile folder contains all of the painting that were done in Krita
and Adobe Photoshop.  
These files also make it easier to do adjustmets
to the images that we have.   
Some of the psd files had to be splitted
since their file size was too big.

Sound effects are made using SFXR. A small neat program for making different sound effects.  
Author lets you use it for anything you want, and it is licensed under MIT free software license.
